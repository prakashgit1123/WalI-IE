# WalI-IE

It has few scenarios which is not implemented yet. 

Few WIP : 

1) This app has no offline databse storage implemented, so It can not store Image to show it offline or the last cached image. 
2) The app is not detecting the network properly when network is not available during the launch and suddenly enabling the network before it loads.
